## Methodology

Literature: https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf

To conclude the methodology section of the paper, the authors developed a fast and scalable probabilistic model designed to merge large-scale administrative records more effectively than traditional deterministic methods. This model, called fastLink, addresses issues such as missing data, measurement error, and the uncertainty inherent in merging processes, which are common in social science research. By incorporating auxiliary information, such as name frequency or migration rates, and allowing for robust simulation studies, the proposed methodology significantly outperforms deterministic approaches. Furthermore, it offers an open-source solution to merge data sets efficiently while providing tools for post-merge analyses that account for the uncertainty of the matching process​

## Model Framework and Structures

### Setup
The method involves merging two datasets, \( A \) and \( B \), each containing \( NA \) and \( NB \) records respectively. They use \( K \) linkage variables for comparisons. The model defines an agreement vector \( g(i, j) \) for each record pair \( (i, j) \), where \( g_k(i, j) \) defines the similarity of the k-th variable between records \( i \) from \( A \) and \( j \) from \( B \).

### Model Formulation
- **Linkage Variables**: Uses Bernoulli random variables \( M_{ij} \) that identify whether a record pair \( (i, j) \) matches (\( M_{ij} = 1 \)) or not (\( M_{ij} = 0 \)). In other words, The model uses simple yes/no variables, represented mathematically as Bernoulli random variables \( M_{ij} \). These variables help decide whether a pair of records \( (i, j) \) from two different datasets is a match (\( M_{ij} = 1 \)) or not (\( M_{ij} = 0 \)). Think of it as a sophisticated way of saying “these two records are talking about the same thing/person.”
- **Conditional Distributions**: Assumes conditional independence among linkage variables given the match status \( M_{ij} \). In other words, each variable's match status (like name, address) does not depend on each other after knowing whether the overall records match. This could enable the decomposition of the joint probability distribution into simpler, individual probabilities.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Utilizes a Missing At Random (MAR) framework to allow the omission of missing data in the probability calculations, which simplifies the likelihood function and enhances computational efficiency.

## Algorithm and Computation

### EM Algorithm
The parameter estimation is executed using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It starts with an initial guess, then repeatedly adjusts this guess aiming to improve the likelihood that the observed data came from the proposed model. This optimizes the observed-data likelihood function, which integrates over the probabilistic distributions of the linkage variables conditioned on the match hypotheses.

### Blocking and Filtering
To reduce computational demands:
- **Blocking**: To avoid comparing every record in one dataset with every record in another, which can be overwhelmingly time-consuming with large datasets, the model groups records into blocks based on shared characteristics (like all people with the same birth year), which greatly cuts down on unnecessary comparisons.
- **Filtering**: Eliminates highly unlikely pairs from consideration early in the process, using thresholds based on calculated probabilities.

### Scalability
The algorithm is designed to work efficiently even with very large datasets that contain millions of records. It uses parallel processing (splitting the work across multiple computer processors) and smart data structures to manage this, making it practical to run on a typical laptop without needing supercomputer resources.

## Evaluation and Implementation

### Simulation Studies
The model's robustness is tested through simulations that mimic real-world problems like incomplete data or errors in the data (measurement errors). These simulations help verify that the model can handle different types of common data issues effectively. The model is compared to traditional methods (like exact match), showing that it can handle complex, imperfect data more effectively and efficiently.

## Statistical Analysis Post-Merging

### Uncertainty Quantification
The model quantifies the uncertainty in the merging process, allowing researchers to account for potential errors in subsequent analyses, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of research conclusions.

### Post-Merge Analysis
Discusses methodologies for incorporating the probabilities of matches into regression analyses and other statistical procedures to adjust for the uncertainty inherent in the linkage process.

## Contributions and Innovations

The model makes substantial contributions to the field of data management by providing:
- A robust probabilistic framework that substantially outperforms traditional deterministic methods. Unlike older methods that just said 'yes' or 'no' to whether records match, this model calculates how likely it is that records match. This approach gives us a clearer picture and usually results in better performance.
- Enhanced handling of missing data and the independence assumptions of linkage variables, which have been a significant limitation in earlier models.
- Detailed documentation and an accessible implementation in R, which facilitates reproducible research and widespread adoption in the social sciences.
