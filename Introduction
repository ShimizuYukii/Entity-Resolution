FastLink is a entity resolution methodology designed to merge large-scale datasets efficiently, addressing challenges such as missing data, measurement errors, and uncertainty in the merging process. Compared to traditional deterministic techniques, which rely on exact matching criteria, FastLink offers more flexibility by leveraging auxiliary information (e.g., name frequency, migration rates) and providing a probabilistic match score. This allows for more accurate linking of records even when data is incomplete or imprecise. Its scalability makes it suitable for handling millions of records, outperforming many existing methods in both speed and accuracy. However, FastLink has limitations when dealing with long strings, such as full names or addresses, where variations and typographical errors can reduce its effectiveness, especially without robust string-matching algorithms to support such cases.
